# Project Chandrasekhar

Project Chandrasekhar aims to catapult satellites into space. We all know how expensive satellite launches can be. Well, it is all about to change now. Rocket launches can be very costly, and a failure will be disastrous. So, we thought, why not use trebuchets? The advantages are clear: cheap launches, less impacting failures and smaller equipment. This also requires less expertise to operate. So, this results in quick, successive satellite launches and access to space for all.
